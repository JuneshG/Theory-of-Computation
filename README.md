## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate key concepts from **automata theory** and **formal languages**, including:
- **Finite automata**: Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) simulation.
- **Context-free grammars**: Parsing and analyzing languages generated by context-free grammars.

Both concepts are crucial in theoretical computer science and lay the foundation for modern compilers and language parsers.

## Project Overview

This repository contains two main C++ programs:
1. **Finite Automata Simulation**: A C++ program to simulate the behavior of deterministic finite automata, where each input string is evaluated for acceptance or rejection by the automaton.
   
2. **Context-Free Grammar Parser**: A C++ program that checks strings' validity based on context-free grammar. This involves parsing input strings and determining whether they belong to the language the grammar describes.

### Features:
- DFA transition simulation based on state diagrams.
- Parsing of context-free grammars (CFGs).
- Efficient handling of large input strings using optimized data structures.
- Error detection and handling for invalid transitions or input strings.
